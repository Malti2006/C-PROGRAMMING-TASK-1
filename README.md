##OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project:  FILE HANDLING PROGRAM

The main objective of a file handling program is to enable a program to interact with data stored in files, allowing for the creation, reading, writing, and updating of files. This allows programs to store and retrieve data persistently, rather than losing it when the program terminates. It enables developers to interact with external files, such as text files, to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

Key Concepts
1. File Input/Output (I/O): Reading and writing data to files.
2. File Pointers: Pointers used to access and manipulate files.
3. File Modes: Different modes for opening files (e.g., read, write, append).

File Operations
1. Opening a File: Using fopen() to open a file in a specific mode.
2. Reading from a File: Using fread(), fscanf(), or fgets() to read data from a file.
3. Writing to a File: Using fwrite(), fprintf(), or fputs() to write data to a file.
4. Closing a File: Using fclose() to close a file.
   
Project Ideas
1. Student Record System: Create a program to store and manage student records in a file.
2. Text Editor: Develop a simple text editor that allows users to create, edit, and save files.
3. Database Management: Design a program to manage a simple database stored in a file.

Technology I used to complete my program 
1. Programming Tools: visual Studio Code.
2. operating system: windows I used C compliers like MinGW.
By using these tools and libraries, we can create a file handling program in C that can perform various operations, such as reading, writing, and modifying files.
